This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The data contains the following columns:

__id__ column, __imdb_id__ column, the __popularity__ column which describes how popular the movie is, the __budget__ column which describes how much it costs to fully produce the film, the __revenue__ column which describes the amount of money the film made, the __original_title__ which states the film title, __cast__ column which lists the films actors separated by a pipe(|), the __homepage__ column which holds a direct link to the film, __director__ column which names the director of the film, __tagline__ which carries the catchphrase of the film, __keywords__ which hold the words most commonly used to describe the movie separated by a pipe(|), __overview__ column which describes the plot of the film briefly, the __runtime__ column which describes how long the film is in minutes, __genres__ column which describes all the genres a film falls into separated by a pipe (|), __production_companies__ which holds all the production companies involved in producing the film separated by a pipe (|), the __release_date__ which details the exact date a film was released,the __vote_count__ which describes the number of user rating votes, __vote_average__ column which describes the average rating of a film, __release_year__ which describes the year a film was released, __budget_adj__ which describes the budget adjusted for inflation, and __revenue_adj__ which describes the revenue adjusted for inflation.

Examining this dataset, i will be looking to answer the following specific questions:
    
    1. What year raked in the highest revenue for a movie? And what movie was it?
    2. What year raked in the lowest revenue for a movie?And what movie was it?
    3. Does the budget have a direct influence on the revenue, is there any correlation?
       Does the budget have a direct influence on the popularity, is there any correlation?
       Does the budget have a direct influence on the vote_avergae, is there any correlation?
       Is revenue linked with popularity?
       Is revenue linked with vote_average?
    4. What year was the most amount of movies released and what year was the least amount of movies released?
    5. Which years made the most and the least average profit??
    6. What runtime of movies is most popular amongst fans?
    7. Which genre is the most released?

# CONCLUSION
1. Drama, Comedy, Thriller and Action are the four most-made genres.
2. Maximum number of movies released in a year was in year 2014.
3. 'Avatar' is the most profitable movie and also generated the most revenue.
4. Short or long duration movies are more popular than long duration movies.
5. Average runtime of the movies is decreasing year by year.
6. Revenue is directly connected to the budget. Movies with higher budgets have shown a corresponding increase in the revenues.
8. Popularity is directly connected to revenue. Movies with higher popularity have shown a corresponding increase in the revenues.

# LIMITATIONS
This is not a 100 percent guaranteed solution that this formula is gonna work, but the analysis shows that we have high probability of making high profits if we have similar characteristics as listed within the conclusion above:
    1. A runtime between 100 and 200 minutes,
    2. A movie which is Drama, Comedy, Thriller or Action,
    3. A movie with a high budget.
If we release a movie with these characteristics, it gives people high expectations from the movie. This is just one example of an influential factor that would likely lead to promising results, there are many that have to be taken care of.
